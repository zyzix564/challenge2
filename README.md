# Challenge 2: Making a Portfolio

## Project Description
---
An individual's portfolio is an important step when it comes to entering the job market. An impressive portfolio exhbits one's skills in an accessible manner to any potential employer. In this project I used my HTML and CSS skills to create a portfolio of my own.

## What I did
---
* I added My name, a recent photo, and a navbar with links to my projects and contact information.
* I added interactivity to my nav links to direct a viewers attention to various sections of my page.
* I added titled images representing my various works and made them function as links to each individual work.
* I added media queries in the CSS file in order to make my page more easily viewable on various devices.
